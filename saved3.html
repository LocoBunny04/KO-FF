            <h2><p></h2>
            <!--<h2>V: 'Oh my beautiful wife-ie...' As he spoke, he brought his face closer to mine - making me turn my head in the opposite direction.</h2>-->
            <h3>I looked at the guy. He had brown eyes and blonde hair. His hair was hid under a cap. He looked at me funny and began to giggle. His smile was just like the sun, bright. It made my face hot and I could feel my cheeks reddening.
                I could hear footsteps coming closer and soon, 7 more people was in the room.
                <h2>"What happened?!" said a girl.</h2>
                <p></p><h2>"Noona! When did you come here!!" a cute guy with brown hair.</h2>
                <p></p><h2>"I had to check on my little brother Hobie" she said. The girl had big brown eyes with a long ponytail.</h2>
                <p></p><h2>Hobie: (sulking) "But... Mina..." </h2>
                <p></p><h2>Mina: "All boys out" Mina shouted.</h2>
                <p></p><h3>Soon, it was just me and her alone in the room. She sat down beside me and started talking.</h3>
                <p></p><h2>Mina: "How are you feeling?" she asked.</h2>
                <h3>I just nodded and she smiled.</h2>
                <p></p><h2>Mina: "Oh good, I was worried if it was too much with the guys around you."</h2>
                <h3>I shook my head, denying her thought.</h2>
                <p></p><h2>Mina: "Maybe we should get you something to change into?" she asked.</h3>
                <h3>She left the room and soon, she was back with a shirt and some sweatpants.</h3>
                <p></p><h2>Mina: "Here" she said, smiling.</h2>
                <p></p><h2>"Wear this for now" she said as she left the room.</h2>
                <p></p><h3>I changed clothes and went outside the room. The clothes looked very big on me, but very warm. I heard talking downstairs but couldn't make out the words. I went down to find out what they talked about. When I got down, I felt all eyes on me as everything got quiet. I quickly looked down on the floor as I heard a breaking sound.</h2>
                <p></p><h3>I looked up in shock to see a guy who was standing beside a pile of broken glass.
                <p></p><h2> Mina: "Rapmon! Not again!" </h2>
                <p></p><h3>The guy called Rapmon was in panic and yelling stuff like "I didn't do anything" and "Why always me".
                 Mina walked up to me, smiling.
                 <p></p><h2>Mina: "Are you okay? Were you scared?" she asked.
                    <p></p><h3>I shaked my head.
                Mina sighted in relief as she looked at the guys.
                <p></p><h2>RM: "Maybe we should introduce ourself?" suggested as he cleaned up the mess.
                    <p></p><h3>Mina smiled as she pointed on a guy.
                        <p></p><h2>Mina: "He is Hoseok also called J-hope. He is my little brother."
                            <p></p><h3>I bowed to to him as she pointed on another guy.
                                <p></p><h2>Mina: "This is Jungkook, he is the youngest in the group."
                                    <p></p><h3>He smiled at me as I bowed my head for him.
                                        <p></p><h2>Mina: "The one who cleans up is Rapmon or Rapmonster. His real name is Kim Namjoon. Be careful around him, you never know when things are going to break."
                "The person beside him is V. We don't know why he is so "Special" so we call him Alien. Don't worry, he has a proper name."
                <p></p><h3>V brought a finger to his mouth, showing Mina to not tell me.
                    <p></p><h2>Mina: "It's Taehyung" she whispered.
                "The short guy over there is Jimin." she said smiling.
                <p></p><h3>The guy called Jimin started shouting:
                    <p></p><h2>Jimin: "YA! NOONA! I AM JUST 1CM SHORTER THAN SUGA-HYUNG"
                        <p></p><h2>"Calm down Jimin" a guy said.
                            <p></p><h2>Mina: "That is Jin, he is the oldest one" Mina explained.
                                <p></p><h3>I looked over to the blonde guy who I met earlier.
                I found myself exited to know who he was.
                <p></p><h2>"I am Suga, but call me Yoongi." he said. His voice was deep and made my heart beat faster.
                    <p></p><h2>Mina: "They are all in a boy group called Bangtan sonyeondan, Or BTS for short."
                
                        <p></p><h3>I smiled after knowing his name. My smile disappeared quickly as I realized why I was here.
                Mina looked at me and asked.
                "What is your name, and who are you?
                
                <p></p><h2>Y/N: "I am...."</h2>
