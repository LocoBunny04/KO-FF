                <h2><p></p>Mark: Mr. Lee, I want the Busan project to be sorted out so we can start the project early. I hope next month the project can start<p></p>Mr. Lee: Yes sir.
                <p></p>Mark: Okay, then...you guys can be dismissed, the meeting is over. [I stand up and walk out of the meeting room]
