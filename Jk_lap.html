        <h2>Y/N POV</h2>
        <p>After completing an long and exhausting day at work, I finally stepped inside my house and let out a sigh of tiredness. 
        <p>Putting my shoes in the shoe rack, I felt a pair of muscular arms wrap around my body. Knowing who it was, I smiled lightly as I leaned myself onto him, relying on him to keep my balance.</p>
        <h2>Jungkook: "Welcome back home hun." </h2><p>Kookie spoke in my ear softly as my smile grew wider, hearing his voice even after half a day. </p>
        <h2>Kookie: "Tired?"</h2><p>He spoke, resting his chin on my shoulder, I nodded lightly at his question.</p><h2>Y/N: "Very much so..."</h2>
        <p>I turned around and buried my face into his chest while hugging him. He started to caress my head in a soothing rhythm.</p>
        <h2>Kookie: "Go and take a shower, you'll feel better."</h2><p>He placed some kisses on my head while I giggled softly.</p>
        <h2>Y/N: "By the way, have you eaten your dinner?"</h2><p>I looked up at him and he shook his head no.</p><h2>Kookie: "I was waiting for you."</h2><p></p><h2>Y/N: "Why? I told you that I'll be late."</h2><p></p>
        <h2>Kookie: "So what? How could I have dinner alone just because I came home earlier from the office; while my lovely wife was still working hard?"</h2><p>I chuckled at him as his lips formed into a little pout, which made him look so adorable.
            He scrunched his nose as I continue to giggle.</p><h2>Y/N: "Well, I'm going to take a quick shower. Then we can eat together after that."</h2><p></p><h2>Kookie: "Okay, I'm going to heat up our food"</h2>
            <p>Leaving a peck on his cheek, I headed upstairs, towards our shared bedroom while he went to the kitchen.</p><p>After having a refreshing bath, I stepped into our bedroom and found a pre-laid out nightwear, I smiled appeared on my lips.</p>
            <h2>Y/N: "How sweet..."</h2><p>I whispered in a dreamy tone. I changed into the outfit. Jungkook had always been like that, a caring, responsible, loving husband - which every woman dream to have.
                Even though our marriage was arranged, even from the very first day, Jungkook was so sincere, responnsible and caring towards me. and headed downstairs.</p><h2></h2>
