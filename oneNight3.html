            <h2><p></h2>
            <!--<h2>V: 'Oh my beautiful wife-ie...' As he spoke, he brought his face closer to mine - making me turn my head in the opposite direction.</h2>-->
                <h3>It didn't take more than a few minutes for Bambam to realise he wanted more. He wanted all of Y/N. So he turned the tables and took the lead again. He discarded their last pieces of clothing and took a moment to admire the sight.
                Y/N's soft, silky skin glowed in the low light of her room and her lustful gaze that was set upon him drove him crazy.
                
                <p></p><h3>After having taken care of protection, Bambam layed Y/N down on the soft carpet and positioned himself over her. Slowly he entered her and a moan escaped from both their lips.
                
                Bambam moved slow and sensual. As a dancer he knew how to use his hips and she met each of his thrusts with a smooth movement of her own.
                
                Y/N always thought of herself as a girl that likes it rough when it comes to sex. Y/N liked the feeling of being dominated and having a powerful man in bed. But the way Bambam made her feel right now made her question all that.
                Moans filled her small apartment and a thin layer of sweat settled on both their bodies. Bambam lasted longer than she expected.
                
                <p></p><h3>Of course he wasn't Y/N's first - she'd had sex with more mature and experienced men, but they were mostly focused on getting off themselves. But Bambam was so set on making her feel good - and she did. It was nice to not take care of it herself but just to enjoy
                the feeling of him inside her.
                
                When it was over, Bambam carefully layed down on top of her and buried his face in her shoulder, placing soft kisses on her sweaty skin. Y/N's legs were still wrapped around his waist and her fingertips drew random shapes on his back.
                
                <p></p><h2>Bambam:"I'm sorry." I murmured.
                
                    <p></p><h2>Y/N: "For what?" I asked still breathless.
                
                        <p></p><h2>Bambam:"For finishing before you did." I answered.
                
                            <p></p><h2>Y/N: "Don't worry. I never do the first time." I said and placed my hands on his cheeks to make him look at me.
                                <p></p><h3>She kissed him passionately and he got lost again in the feeling of her lips against his.
                
                A couple of minutes later Bambam pushed himself off Y/N and she winced at the empty feeling she was left with. Bambam pecked her lips once again before going to the bathroom to get rid of the used condom and cleaning himself off.
                
                <p></p><h3>Y/N just stayed on the floor watching his cute butt as he waddled away. A lazy smile grazed her lips and she tried to comprehend the fact that she just seduced a three years younger K-Pop idol.
                Actually, they've known each other for a few months now - and he wasn't just some famous person she met randomly - but rather a friend, but still.
                They would be in a lot of trouble if anyone found out. Bambam had broken his contract in regards of his dating ban (but did having a one night stand even fall under the term of dating, she thought) and if someone saw him coming here or leave in the morning she would probably be kicked out of her dorm.
                Not to mention the rumours - or worse a scandal - that would be exploited by the media.
                
                <p></p><h3>A frown had replaced the smile over these thoughts but was soon wiped away when Bambam returned to her and pulled her close to his naked chest.
                
                    <p></p><h2>Bambam:"Are you alright?" I asked concerned.
                
                        <p></p><h2>Y/N: "Just thinking about the consequences." I sighed.
                
                            <p></p><h2>Bambam: "Let's not think about that right now. We can deal with it tomorrow." I placed butterfly kisses from her: earlobe down her jawline, neck to her shoulder.
                
                                <p></p><h3>The sensation of Bambam's soft lips tickling Y/N's skin sent chills down her spine and his warm body against her paired with the rest of the alcohol in her blood made her sleepy and soon both were fast asleep on the soft grey carpet of her bedroom.
