            <h2><p></h2>
            <!--<h2>V: 'Oh my beautiful wife-ie...' As he spoke, he brought his face closer to mine - making me turn my head in the opposite direction.</h2>-->
            <h2>Y/N: As my feet started hurting, it became harder to breathe and I didn't know where I was. I looked around to see where I was, however, all I could see was an empty dark street. My white summer dress was dirty and my feet was cold. I had forgotten to grab my shoes before I ran. It was cold, I was hungry and in shock my body grew weaker and weaker, my vision got blurred and all I could see was black.</h2>
            <p></p><h2>When I woke up, I felt warmth around my whole body. Looking up, I found my self staring at an unfamiliar ceiling, the room was egg white filled with grey furniture. I sat up still dressed in my summer dress - it was still dirty, but I was wearing a grey hoodie. I walked around and saw a big computer. The desk was filled with music sheets and the trash was overflowing. I took one paper and looked at it.
                <h2>The paper was filled with notes and ideas. Walls were covered with cardboards that read: "Suga", "Min Yoongi" and "I love you!!".
                
                <h3>My mind was going around: Min Yoongi? I thought.</h3>
                
                <h2>Right beside the bed there was a shelf filled with plushies and letters. I walked over to the shelf, spotting a huge black box filled with buttons and advanced equipment and many cabeles that were attached to it. As I touched a button, an annoying sound filled the room.
                I sat down and held my hands on my ears, hoping the sound would disappear.
                
                <p></p><h2>Suddenly, I saw a pair of legs before me, and the sound was gone. I looked up, saw a guy with blond hair.</h2>He can't help but to sob, since he finally found the love and care he has been craving for.<p></p><h2>Sometimes, it's not only about friends; but lover(s) too. 
                    <h2>Of course his parents love him dearly; however, they are always busy...that they can't give their attention and care towards him.</h2>
                        <h2>Seeing you show so much care and love...just makes him more emotional. Seeing him crying, I grew more worried, quickly hugging him.
                     <h2>I began rubbing/patting his back slowly as I whispered softly into his ear:<h2>Y/N: 'Shhh. its okay... I'm not mad at you okay...I'm just worried.' I said as he nodded his head while sniffling.<p></p>
                        <h2>Y/N: 'Now, tell me where you got hurt...hmm? So we can treat it.' I slowly parted wiping his tears.<p></p><h2>V: 'Here...and here...and all of my face!' He said while pointing to the spots. He was looking
                            <h2>so cute that I had to squish his cheeks and he winced.</h2><p></p><h2>V: 'Ahhh my face...it hurts!'<p></p>Y/N: I am sorry...I'm sorry, baby.'</h2>
                            <h2>When I called him by his nickname, he couldn't help but to blush. However, I did not noticed since I was too busy rubbing his bruised cheeks.</h2>
                        <p></p><h2>Seeing his blushing face, I smiled widely...pecking him before I said: <p></p>Y/N: 'I LOVE YOU 3000 Taehyung.'<p></p>V: 'ONLY 3000?!'</h2>
                        <p>THE END</p>
