        <h3>Y/N POV</h3>
        <p>After completing a long and exhausting day at work, I finally stepped inside my house and let out a sigh of tiredness. 
        <p>Putting my shoes on the shoe rack, I felt a pair of muscular arms wrap around my body. Knowing who it was, I smiled lightly as I leaned myself onto him, relying on him to keep my balance.</p>
        <h2>Jungkook: "Welcome back home hun." </h2><p>Kookie spoke in my ear softly as my smile grew wider, hearing his voice even after half a day. </p>
        <h2>Kookie: "Tired?"</h2><p>He spoke, resting his chin on my shoulder, I nodded lightly at his question.</p><h2>Y/N: "Very much so..."</h2>
        <p>I turned around and buried my face into his chest while hugging him. He started to caress my head in a soothing rhythm.</p>
        <h2>Kookie: "Go and take a shower, you'll feel better."</h2><p>He placed some kisses on my head while I giggled softly.</p>
        <h2>Y/N: "By the way, have you eaten your dinner?"</h2><p>I looked up at him and he shook his head no.</p><h2>Kookie: "I was waiting for you."</h2><p></p><h2>Y/N: "Why? I told you that I'll be late."</h2><p></p>
        <h2>Kookie: "So what? How could I have dinner alone just because I came home earlier from the office; while my lovely wife was still working hard?"</h2><p>I chuckled at him as his lips formed into a little pout, which made him look so adorable.
            He scrunched his nose as I continue to giggle.</p><h2>Y/N: "Well, I'm going to take a quick shower. Then we can eat together after that."</h2><p></p><h2>Kookie: "Okay, I'm going to heat up our food"</h2>
            <p>Leaving a peck on his cheek, I headed upstairs, towards our shared bedroom while he went to the kitchen.</p><p>After having a refreshing bath, I stepped into our bedroom and found a pair of nightwear on our bed. A smile appeared on my lips.</p>
            <h2>Y/N: "How sweet..."</h2><p>I whispered in a dreamy tone. I changed into the outfit. Jungkook had always been like that, a caring, responsible, loving husband - which every woman dreams to have.
                Even though our marriage was arranged, even from the very first day, Jungkook was so sincere, responsible, and caring toward me. 
            </p><p>He has always assured me from the beginning that if I was not comfortable with him, I could take things as slow as I need. He has always stood by my side in every situation.
                He has never pressured me to do anything and respect my decision with every condition.</p>
                <p>I've always wanted a man in my life like my Kookie. How could I stay without falling in love with him? <h2>Y/N: "You can't it's not possible!"</h2></p>
                <p>Ever since I first met him, I've always been thankful to God for putting him into my life. There is not a day I can imagine where I'm not living and loving him. I will forever be thankful my parents chose Jungkook as my husband.</p>
                <p>After changing into comfortable clothes, I headed downstairs as Kookie was waiting for me. I was hella hungry but Kookie was probably more hungry having waited for me. Stepping inside the kitchen, I found the food already served and JK placing glasses on the table.</p>
                <h2>Kookie: "Oh you came have a seat."</h2><p>He smiled which I gladly returned with a smile of my own and sat down. We both started to eat.</p>
                    <h2>Kookie: "How is it?"</h2><p>He asked my opinion after a few seconds of silence.</p><h2>Y/N: "As good as always. Have you ever cooked something bad?"</h2><p></p><h2>Kookie: "No but you cook better than me."</h2><p></p><h2>Y/N: "I know I do, don't need to say that."</h2>
                    <p>After dinner, we both helped each other clean up while teasing each other, creating some sweet memories.</p><h3>A while later...</h3>
                    <p>Clicking the send button, Jungkook stretched his arms, sipped his coffee, and then continued to send another email. A while later I stepped inside the living room as Kookie's gaze fell on me.</p>
                    <h2>Kookie: "You haven't slept yet?"</h2><p></p><h2>Y/N: "No, I can't fall asleep without you." *pouting*</h2><p>I said in a sleepy tone while pouting causing him to chuckle at my cuteness.</p>
                    <h2>Kookie: "Well, come here then."</h2><p>Moving the laptop to the side, he extended his hands towards me; signaling for me to come. I approached him with my eyes half open.</p>
                    <p>Grabbing my wrist gently, he tugged me towards himself, making me sit on his lap. I nuzzled my face into his neck while hugging him.</p>
                    <h2>Y/N: "What are you doing? Why didn't you go to bed?"</h2><p></p><h2>Kookie: "I was reading some emails and replying to them hun.</h2><p></p><h2>Y/N: "Why now? Didn't you work at your office?"</h2><p></p>
                    <h2>Kookie: "Yeah I did but these emails are important and I have to check them all before tomorrow."</h2><p></p><h2>Y/N: "Oh, how many are left?"</h2><p></p><h2>Kookie: "Not to many left."</h2><p></p>
                    <h2>Y/N: "Oh well then, you can continue your work, I am going to stay like this for a while. Mind if I do?"</h2><p>I looked up at him with puppy eyes as he chuckled giving me a small peck on my lips.</p>
                    <h2>Kookie: "Why would I? By the way, will you be comfortable like this?"</h2><p></p><h2>Y/N: "Why wouldn't I? This is the most comfortable place for me."</h2><p>I nuzzled his neck again, leaving a kiss there while he chuckled at my actions.</p>
                    <h2>Y/N: "By the way, I haven't asked yet...how was your day? Your company was working and presenting a deal right?"</h2><p>He hummed in response.</p><h2>Kookie: "They agreed on the deal. Now, nothing will stop our company from becoming the top of Seoul."</h2><p></p><h2>Y/N: "Wow! Congrats."</h2>
                    <p></p><h2>Kookie: "Thanks, by the way, what about you? Your team and yourself were working on a project right?"</h2><p></p><h2>Y/N: "Yeah, we finished it today, and presented it. I hope everything will turn out in our favor."</h2><p></p>
                    <h2>Kookie: "Great"</h2><p></p><h2>Y/N: "Hmmm...one more thing, the boss said that since we finished the project without any mistakes, all of us will get a paid vacation for a week!"</h2><p></p><h2>Kookie: "Great! Then, I'll also take a week's leave. We can go somewhere, somewhere warmer. It'll be good for refreshing our minds, right?"</h2>
                    <p></p><h2>Y/N: "Not a bad idea."</h2><p></p><h2>Kookie: "So, where will we go?"</h2><p></p><h2>Y/N: "Let's think about that later. Let me relax for a moment, you are talking too much. And you are supposed to be working!"</h2><p></p>
                    <h2>Kookie: "Sorry, sorry.. I'll do my work now. *chuckles*"</h2><p></p><h2>Y/N: "Hmmm...finish it asap so we can get to bed quickly."</h2><p>Keeping the laptop at his side, Kook started to work with one of his hands while the other softly caressed my head. Feeling the warmth, I soon drifted off to sleep.</p>
                    <p>After half an hour, Jungkook finally finished his work, he looked at me, who already was deep in her dreamland while in his embrace.</p><p>Looking at me, and my small pouty lips, peacefully sleeping face, Jungkook couldn't help but smile at my cuteness.</p><h2>Kookie: "Such an angel who has enlightened my world."</h2>
                    <p>Placing a soft kiss on my forehead, he kept staring at me for a couple of minutes - admiring my beauty. ;) Jungkook never thought that his arranged marriage could bring this much happiness into his life. He has always felt the luckiest whenever he stays with me.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes, but rarely he feels pity for those men who I have rejected to make my partner as he feels so lucky that a person like me chose him as my better half. After admiring me, Jungkook carefully carried me in his arms so that he wouldn't wake me up from my slumber.</p>
                    <p>Jungkook then headed towards our shared bedroom, and he too fell deep into his own dreamland with his love, his life, and his reasons in his arms.</p>
