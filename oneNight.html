                <h6>Summary: When Bambam showed up at her door one night, she didn't think it would go this far.
            <!--<h2>V: 'Oh my beautiful wife-ie...' As he spoke, he brought his face closer to mine - making me turn my head in the opposite direction.</h2>-->
            <h2>Narrator: Y/N: had just changed into her pajamas when there was a loud knock on her door.
                <p><h3>(Confused) Who would come to her at almost 10pm she went up to the door and cracked it opened.
                She was met with a bright smile on a familiar face with a set of two shining dark brown eyes looking down on her.
                
                <p></p><h2>Y/N: "Bambam? What are you doing here?" I hissed and opened the door wider before pulling him into my one bedroom apartment and checked the hallway to see if someone had noticed him.
                "This is an all girl's dorm! I'm in big trouble if someone has seen you!" I scolded him.
                
                <p></p><h2>Bambam: "I know. But don't worry. I've been careful." he reassured her.
                
                    <p></p><h3>She sighed. This man was so reckless.
                
                        <p></p><h2>Y/N: "Well, what are you doing here?" I asked again.
                
                            <p></p><h2>Bambam: "I know the last few weeks were rough for you but your exams are over and you've got your first real job. I think this is a reason to celebrate." I smirked and raised my hands to show the two bags I had brought.
                
                        <p></p><h2>Y/N: "I swear you'll be the death of me." The young woman shook her head. "I'm tired and need sleep. I have two days to prepare for the job and here you are with what I assume is alcohol and your bad habit of keeping me awake all night."
                
                        <p></p><h2>Bambam: "You're so right!" I flashed another smile and revealed what I had brought. Two bottles of wine, because I knew she didn't like soju or beer, a variety of snacks, and a cheesy korean drama.
                
                            <p></p><h2>Y/N: "Bambam..." I whined.
                
                                <p></p><h2>Bambam: "Oh stop it! You know you love me." I pinched her cheeks.
                
                                    <p></p><h2>Y/N: "No you stop it, you punk! Don't forget that I'm 3 years older than you. I demand respect!" I swatted his hand away.
                
                                        <p></p><h2>Bambam: "Ah, sorry. I won't do it again." I bowed apologetically.
                
                                            <p></p><h3>While Bambam set up the TV and put the movie in, the Y/N put the snacks in small bowls and got two wine glasses for them. When everything was ready, they both settled down on her bed and started the movie.
                It was one these dramas that had a bad plot, half talented actors and a whole lot of forced romantic scenes for the protagonists.
                
                After half an hour the first bottle of wine was empty and not much later the prepared snacks were gone but neither of them wanted to get up and refill the bowls.
                The second bottle was halfway empty when both started to feel dizzy and became all giggly when a romantic scene came on.
