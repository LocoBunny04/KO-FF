        <h2 id ="rm">Y/N P.O.V.</h2><p>One day my parents invited me and my husband for dinner. Namjoon and I were getting ready to head over.</p><h2>I wore a beautiful and seductive dress.</h2>
        <p>Namjoon got ready and found you wearing a beautiful and sexy dress.</p><h2>RM: "Umm...Y/N"</h2><h2>Y/N: "Wae? Joon, your ready...that is fast! I'll be ready in five minutes."</h2>
        <h2>RM: "Isn't your dress a bit too reaveling?</h2><h2>Y/N: "So what?"</h2><h2>RM: "Baby we are not going to a party. We are going to a family dinner."</h2><h2>Y/N: "So what?"</h2>
        <h2>RM: *Gulps* "Baby why don't you change into another - less reaveling dress?"</h2><h2>Y/N: "No Joon, if you don't like my dress, don't look at me. Problem solve. End of Discussion. Come on lets go."</h2>
        <p>Arrving to the home, the family dinner began. My dad was speaking to Namjoon. As he continue to talk to Namjoon, I noticed that Joon was mot listening to a single thing my dad was saying his whole attention was on me.</p>
        <h2>Y/N: "Daddy can you pass me the salt?"</h2><p>Both Namjoon and my dad reached for the salt and Namjoon awkwardly looked towards my dad while I choked/coughed hysterically.</p>
        <h2>Y/N:"Umm...I'll just grab it myself." 'What is wrong with my Joon? Why is he embaressing me infront of everyone?'</h2><p>I finished eating and headed towards the kitchen. Namjoon followed soon after.</p>
        <p>I started washing the dishes when I felt a familiar pair of arms wrapping my waist. It was Namjoon, he tighten his grip when I tried turning around, and began kissing my neck.</p>
        <h2>Y/N: "So Joon, what happend to you? You were quite distrubed earlier." He turned me around and looked adoringly into my eyes while I placed my hands on his forehead.</h2>
        <h2>Y/N: "What? Do you have a temperature or something?...You seem fine.</h2><p>Namjoon creased his eyebrows and lifted me up and placed me on the kitchen counter.</p><h2>Y/N: "Hey...what are you doing...?"</h2>
        <p>He smirked and smashed his lips onto mine and began to kiss me roughly. With a smile, I kissed him back. Too immersed into the kiss, we did not hear the approaching footsteps. I subsequently open my eyes and came face to face with
            my dad's, I immediately pushed Namjoon away and hopped off the counter. Embaressed, Namjoon quickly left towards the living room and I went back to doing the dishes.</p>
