            <!--<h2>V: 'Oh my beautiful wife-ie...' As he spoke, he brought his face closer to mine - making me turn my head in the opposite direction.</h2>-->
            <h2>Y/N: As my feet started hurting, it became harder to breathe and I didn't know where I was. I looked around to see where I was, however, all I could see was an empty dark street. My white summer dress was dirty and my feet was cold. I had forgotten to grab my shoes before I ran. It was cold, I was hungry and in shock my body grew weaker and weaker, my vision got blurred and all I could see was black.</h2>
            <p></p><h2>When I woke up, I felt warmth around my whole body. Looking up, I found my self staring at an unfamiliar ceiling, the room was egg white filled with grey furniture. I sat up still dressed in my summer dress - it was still dirty, but I was wearing a grey hoodie. I walked around and saw a big computer. The desk was filled with music sheets and the trash was overflowing. I took one paper and looked at it.
                <h2>The paper was filled with notes and ideas. Walls were covered with cardboards that read: "Suga", "Min Yoongi" and "I love you!!".
                
                <h3>My mind was going around: Min Yoongi? I thought.</h3>
                
                <h2>Right beside the bed there was a shelf filled with plushies and letters. I walked over to the shelf, spotting a huge black box filled with buttons and advanced equipment and many cabeles that were attached to it. As I touched a button, an annoying sound filled the room.
                I sat down and held my hands on my ears, hoping the sound would disappear.
                
                <p></p><h2>Suddenly, I saw a pair of legs before me, and the sound was gone. I looked up, saw a guy with blond hair.</h2>
