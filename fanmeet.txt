"The second one, I'm on my period."
<h2>Jimin: "Aish, I already knew you were going to say that."</h2>
<h3>I just stared at him as we both became silent.</h3>
<h2>Jimin: "When are you coming back? I miss you!"</h2>
<h2>Y/N: "I still don't know, there's still a lot of things to do here."</h2>
<h2>Jimin: "I really want to see you now." *pout*</h2>
<h2>Y/N: "Hey, don't pout, I'm sorry. I promise...all of this will be worth it after I graduate."</h2>
<h2>Jimin: "Time flies so fast, it has already been five years since you left!"</h2>
<h2>Y/N: "And soon I'll come back to Korea for you :)"</h2>
<h3>Jimin forcably smiled at me and nodded</h3>
<h2>Jimin: "I love you"<h2>
<h2>Y/N: "I love you too! By the way, how about your new album? It's a major hit!"</h2>
<h2>Jimin: "Yeah it is, that is why we have been so busy now."</h2>
<h2>Y/N: "Then you should rest now."</h2>
<h2>Jimin: "But I still want to talk to you."</h2>
<h2>Y/N: "Should I end this call now?"</h2>
<h3>I said jokingly, I reached over to close my laptop - my strap fe;ll off my shoulder. I immediately pulled it up as Jimin smirked at me.</h3>
<h2>Jimin: "Do you think I can book a ticket right now?"</h2><h3>I chuckled along with him</h3>
<h2>Y/N: "Whatever, take a rest now, goodnight my sweet mochi...I love you."</h2>
<h2>Jimin: "I love you too, dont stress yourself." <h3>He waved at me and smiled, I gave him a flying kiss and he 'caught it' in return. This caused me to laugh and fall more in love with him. Finally I ended the call.
I continued to lay on my bed, I began to think about my mochi again, I was already his girlfriend long before he was an international idol. Early into our relationship, I already knew that Jimin was more than enough for me. At first, Jimin had decline BigHit's offer, because he did not want to be break up with me. However, the company really wanted him for the group, they reentlessly agreed. </h3>
<h3>We were childhood sweethearts. It has almost been 10 years that we have been together. Regardless of time and status, we were like any other couple we had our own disagreements which would leave us both trustfrated and angry at each other.</h3>
<h3>But what I love about him is that Jimin will not go to sleep until I have forgive him and we mend our relationship. He is the best! He is everything you could ask for in a man, however he can go a little too far with his flirting with Army and other women (if you know what I mean).
I am currently living and studying abroad in Australia, but this was all possible because of Jimin. My parent and only brother died when I was in middle school. After high school, I did not have the means to continue my studies and go to college. Jimin, being the angel he is asked if I would like to go abroad to get the best
education for my field. Because of him I get to achieve my dream. I always knew it would not be easy, I miss my mochi so much, however, I did not want to miss this opportunity and waste the chance of fulfilling my dream.</h3>
<h3>Don't tell anyone this but I am planning on moving back to Korea next month! Of course Jimin did not know I already have graduated - I wanted to surprise him at the next home fan meet event. Yoongi-oppa is the only other person who knows about my surprise becaused I had ask the date of their next home fan meet - regardless of that - I can not keep anything from oppa.
He is too wise and woould find out one way or another. For now I have to wait for the day to arrive and see his reaction.</h3>
Y/N: "I can't wait to see my baby mochi!" <h3>I smiled at the thought and closed my eyes"</h3>

<h5>*2 weeks later* (Jimin POV)</h5>
<h3>I was currently mopping around at our clubhouse livingroom when unexpectedly Taehyung and Jungkook arived early.</h3>
<h2>Jimin: "What is with you two?"</h2><h2>V: "Nothing, we just want to see you."</h2><h2>Jimin:"Tsk tsk hust say that you want to play the PS5."</h2><h2>Jk: "Exactly you get it!"</h2><h2>Jimin: "In my room"</h2><h2>V: "JK, you can play first, I'm going to talk to Jimin real quick. Did you talk with her last night?"</h2>
<h2>Jimin: "What other choice do I have? I have to call her if I want to see her.</h2><h2>V: "You two never stop amazing me, you have been an idol for 5 years now but your relationship is stronger than ever." </h2><h2>Jimin: "If you love someone, you are going to wait for them no matter how long it might take - even if it feels like forever."</h2>
<h2>V: "I don't want to ruin your relationship, but I really want to ask you this for a long time..."</h2><h2>Jimin: "Go ahead"</h2><h2>V: "Have you ever wondered or doubt if Y/N may have already found someone else there in Australia?</h2><h3>He asked as I look down and smile</h3>
<h2>Jimin: "I know that Y/N couldn't do that. She can't even lie, if she did lie to you, she wouldn't be able to face you or she will end up telling you the truth and say sorrry. I trust her.</h2><h2>V: "Yeah that is her"</h2><h2>Jimin: "She is too precious, that I will patiently wait for her to come back."</h2>
<h2>V: "I remember when we were still in high school, when you tried to prank me she was the person I asked, and she told me right away where my shoes were because you freaking hid it!</h2><h3>He said as we both chuckled</h3>
<h5>At the airport on phone (Y/N POV)</h5>
<h2>Yoongi: "We are already on our way."</h2><h2>I'm already at the shuttle area where are you?</h2><h2>Yoongi: "Don't worry I am in a different van</h2>
