            <!--<h2>V: 'Oh my beautiful wife-ie...' As he spoke, he brought his face closer to mine - making me turn my head in the opposite direction.</h2>-->
                <h2>Y/N: "Hey Bambam, have you ever watched a movie upside down?"
                
                    <p></p><h3>The young man looked at her strangely but didn't answer.
                
                When her guest didn't reply she just switched her sitting position and threw her legs over the frame of her bed while her head dangled down in the front.
                
                <p></p><h2>Bambam: "And you always say I am the weird one." he chuckled but followed suit.
                
                    <p></p><h3>He only lasted a few minutes in this position before he straightened up again and rubbed his forehead.
                
                        <p></p><h2>Bambam: "How can you stay like this for so long? My head feels like it's going to explode."
                
                            <p></p><h2>Y/N: "It's a talent I guess." I only shrugged and laughed.
                
                            <p></p><h3> When the movie was finished they were both sitting on the floor, their backs leaning against her bed and her head resting on his shoulder.
            
                                <p></p><h2>Y/N:"That was one of the worst movies I've ever seen." I stated.
            
                                    <p></p><h2>Bambam:"I agree." I chuckled. "So what now?"
            
                                    <p></p><h2>"I need chocolate. Wine makes me crave sugar." she stood on wobbly legs and stumbled into her small kitchen.
        
                                        <p></p><h3>Bambam couldn't help but notice how her pajama shorts hugged her butt just right and how her hips swayed sensually with every of her tipsy steps. A low groan escaped his lips and he rubbed his hands over his face trying to get rid of his naughty thoughts. After all, she was 3 years older than him and always treated him like a little brother. He couldn't imagine her seeing him as something else.
                But still, she was pretty and had a nice body. And he was just out of his teenage years and had built up a lot of sexual frustration.
                
                She rummaged through her kitchen cabinets until she finally found what she was looking for. Her favourite dark chocolate with almond chunks. She immediately put a piece in her mouth and let it melt on her tongue.
                Taking the whole pack of chocolate with her, she went back to her main room but stopped at the door to look at the young man still sitting on the floor.
                
                <p></p><h3>His head was leaned back and his eyes were closed and she used this opportunity to stare at him unashamedly. Y/N always thought Bambam was attractive with his sharp facial features, but it would take another two or three years for him to grow into the man he promised to become.
                She had seen pictures of him from a few years ago and almost couldn't believe it was really Bambam smiling at her from a photo. Puberty had hit him hard.
                
                While Y/N was looking him up and down, she hadn't noticed him opening his eyes and staring right back at her.
                
                <p></p><h2>Bambam: "Are you okay?" I asked.
                
                    <p></p><h3>Y/N jerked out of her thoughts and met his eyes. For a few seconds they only held each other's gaze in silence. Then she started moving again. Slowly she walked over and placed a foot on either side of his legs before lowering herself onto his lap.
                Y/N could hear Bambam's breath hitch in his throat.
                
                <p></p><h2>Bambam: "What... are you doing?" I stuttered nervously.
                
                <p></p><h3>Instead of answering, Y/N softly placed her lips against his and waited. When he didn't react in any way, Y/N began kissing him slowly. And after endless seconds he started to kiss her back.
                They were both careful in the beginning, just testing the waters, but soon enough his hands snaked around her waist and hers tangled in his platinum blonde hair.
                
                <p></p><h3>She was surprised when she felt his tongue tracing her lower lip but wasted no time in opening her mouth to grant him entrance.
                Y/N had let Bambam take the lead and only responded to his movements. Their tongues played with each other and low groans of pleasure escaped from both their throats.
                Although Y/N didn't know how experienced Bambam was, she had to admit he was an excellent kisser.</h3>
                
                <p></p><h3>Their hands were starting their journey across each other's body, slowly feeling up and down, sometimes stopping to grab at the other's shirt or hair and things began heating up.
                Bambam got bold enough to slowly push Y/N's shirt up a bit and feeling her bare skin for the first time. In response, Y/N raised her arms as an invitation for him to take her shirt off and got payed with a moan.
                Bambam threw her shirt off to the side and was a bit disappointed to see that she was wearing a sports bra underneath.
                
                <p></p><h2>Y/N: She giggled at his expression and playfully nudged him. "Impatient, are we?"
                
                    <p></p><h2>Bambam: "Yes. You're such a tease." he managed to get out between heated kisses.
                
                        <p></p><h2>Y/N: "I know. And that's the fun part about it." she purred in his ear.
